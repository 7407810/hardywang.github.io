## About Me

I am a Research Scientist at Guoneng Digital Intelligence Technology Development (Beijing) Co., Ltd. I obtained my Master's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2023, and prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies at North China Electric Power University.


## Research Interests

My research focuses on the exciting field of image enhancement and its practical applications. By improving the quality of low-light or otherwise suboptimal images, this work enables more accurate analysis and decision-making in areas such as surveillance, medical imaging, and remote sensing.
